# Austin-Displacement-Alert
Austin Texas Displacement Risk Mapping 

## MISSION:
There is no local, real-time tracking of eviction and (more generally) displacement data for Austin, Texas. While Evictionlab offers great insight into evictions in the Austin metro area through 2016 there is no way to assist people who are currently at-risk of being evicted.

Through this project, we will develop a tool to map current displacement risk for residents of Austin, Texas (inspired by a New York city based tool http://map.dapmapnyc.org/app/). On-the-ground activists would be able to use the geographic information to cut turf, create walk lists, and canvass door-to-door, connecting Austin residents at risk of displacement with useful resources and information they can utilize to prevent or fight back against displacement.


## SOLUTION:
We are creating an interactive map web application, with multiple layers overlayed on the map to describe the risk of resident/tenant displacement.
