A Proactive Approach to Preventing Eviction: Austin Texas Displacement Risk Mapping

## MISSION:
Our mission is to connect residents in high eviction risk areas of Austin, Texas with resources to protect their homes and themselves. Residents at risk of eviction want to keep their houses. They just donâ€™t know what how. Canvassers do not have a singular tool to identify high eviction risk areas, and organize contact in these areas. 

When people leave, the things we love about Austin leaves too. Without these resources, residents lose their homes. And Austin loses the unique support systems, artist, musicians, and diversity that create and define this city.


## SOLUTION:
There is no local, real-time tracking of eviction and (more generally) displacement data for Austin, Texas.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> Through this project, we are developing a tool to map current displacement risk for residents of Austin, Texas (inspired by a New York city based tool http://map.dapmapnyc.org/app/). On-the-ground activists would be able to use the geographic information to cut turf, create walk lists, and canvass door-to-door, connecting Austin residents at risk of displacement with useful resources and information they can utilize to prevent or fight back against displacement.

We are currently in development to build out a heat map visualization tool of displacement risk in Austin. We have analyzed several datasets to determine the displacement risk factors for identified block groups in ATX, and have designed a model of displacement risk in Austin Texas. While we are still working through implementing these plans, we have also designed a preliminary website interface for this tool.
